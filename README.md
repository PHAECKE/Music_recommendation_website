# Project Name: PLAY SUITES
Music_recommendation_website
## INTRODUCTION
This is a platform that helps users   discover new music based on their preferences. The site uses algorithms to analyze the user's listening history, favorite artists, and other data points to suggest similar music that the user may enjoy. Some sites also allow users to create playlists and share them with friends or the wider community. These platforms can be a great way to broaden your musical horizons and discover new artists that you might not have otherwise come across.
